# ChartFudge

There are a lot of great data-driven apps out there, but they all have one thing in common: you need to have data to use them.   What if you don’t have any data?

ChartFudge lets you make great-looking line graphs, even if you don’t have any actual data. Just draw the shape you want and hit “Fudge”, and ChartFudge will generate all the data for you.

Once you’ve made a chart, you can download a PNG image of it or grab the CSV spreadsheet and make a similar chart in the data-vis tool of your choice.
